This project started as an introduction to TypeScript, establishing a type-safe and maintainable codebase. It was enhanced with web container integration to display AI-generated responses, featuring a toggle between code and chat modes. Real-time chat updates were enabled using WebSockets (Socket.io), and secure, industry-standard authentication protocols were implemented for robust user management.
