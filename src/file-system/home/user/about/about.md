# Hi there

Hi, I'm Tushar Mishra â€” an aspiring web developer, AI/ML enthusiast, and full-stack software engineer with a passion for technology and design. I love building intuitive digital experiences, whether it's through software engineering, machine learning, UI/UX, or 3D graphics.

In addition to tech, I'm also drawn to animation and illustration. I enjoy combining creativity with code to bring ideas to life.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed over my fifteen plus years of coding experience.
